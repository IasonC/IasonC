- 👋 Hi, I’m Iason Chaimalas. Current 2nd-year MEng Electronic & Electrical Engineering student at University College London (UCL) in London, UK.
- 👀 I’m interested in Electronic & Electrical Engineering, Software Engineering & Programming, and Machine Learning.
      My degree in UCL teaches me EEE concepts alongside C (procedural) and Python (procedural + object-oriented) programming languages, and I am self-learning ML with Python.
